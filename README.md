Dotfiles for arch linux laptop

I'm just learning the finer details of linux, so this will be a work in progress.  I'll start by uploading the dotfiles that I do have from my laptop.  I can also reogranize them a little bit so that all the config files are found in a single folder.  That will make future customization easier.

As I go, I'll probably discover new packages and new programs that I'll want to try out, so I'll need to create backups and more config files for more programs.

GitHub wants me to add a .gitignore file and a license.

Also looking to add scripts for maintaining/modifying my MTG cube, which is currently on Cube Cobra and locally as an Excel file.  Could use Python + VBA to streamline modifying the Cube Cobra list, and look at data more closely on a per-card basis.
